# Miniproject2_Group3
This is class room project for the CIS 6397 Text mining course
In this problem, weâ€™ll be clustering articles published on Daily Kos, an American political blog that publishes news and opinion articles written from a progressive point of view. Daily Kos was founded by Markos Moulitsas in 2002, and as of September 2014, the site had an average weekday traffic of hundreds of thousands of visits.
The file dailykos (CSV - 10.1MB) contains data on 3,430 news articles or blogs that have been posted on Daily Kos. These articles were posted in 2004, leading up to the United States Presidential Election. The leading candidates were incumbent President George W. Bush (republican) and John Kerry (democratic). Foreign policy was a dominant topic of the election, specifically, the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Each of the variables in the dataset is a word that has appeared in at least 50 different articles (1,545 words in total). The set of words has been trimmed according to some of the techniques covered in the previous weeks (punctuation has been removed, and stop words have been removed). For each document, the variable values are the number of times that a word appeared in the document.
